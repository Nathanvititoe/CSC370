Course Title: Artificial Intelligence
Course Number: CSC370
Course Prerequisites: CSC235
Credit Hours: 3
General Studies Credits: 0


I. Course Description:
In this course, students will explore both historical approaches for AI, as well as the major subfields and
applications of AI today. These include AI in intelligent devices, machine learning, voice recognition, APIs, and
libraries for these implementations. Students will then apply that knowledge to create their own fully functioning AI
applications.


II. Course Objectives:
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will have demonstrated competency in the following
course learning objectives:
  1. Explain the various historical and/or today’s approaches to AI.
  2. Define AI and describe the major subfields of AI today.
  3. Describe which AI subfields or APIs should be used to solve a given problem.
  4. Demonstrate use cases in text-to-text generative AI.
  5. Demonstrate use cases in text-to-music generative AI.
  6. Demonstrate uses cases in text-to-image generative AI.
  7. Demonstrate uses cases in text-to-video generative AI.

   
III. Program Objectives:
The outcomes of this course are aligned and developed to support the following program learning objectives.
• Advancing Computer Science
  o Objective 1: Follow the software development process to analyze a problem and to design, build
and test software solutions.
  o Objective 2: Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming
language and development environment.

• Artificial Intelligence
  o Objective 1: Create and integrate cognitive artificial intelligence into applications.
  o Objective 2: Create and evolve natural language processing systems.
  o Objective 3: Demonstrate proficiency in designing and developing machine learning systems
using industry approaches and patterns.

• Data Science
  o Objective 1: Assess, structure, manage and implement large data sets derived from real-time
sources.
  o Objective 2: Apply statistical tests and tools appropriately to analyze data sets drawn from
different types of sources (nature, humankind, organizations, etc.), making inferences and
projections from the data.
  o Objective 3: Design and implement big data, artificial intelligence and statistical and visual
analysis solutions that provide people and organizations with understanding, guidance and
options drawn from the data.

• Robotics and Embedded Systems
  o Objective 1: Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms
