Expectations / Requirements
Code a new ML application using Python 3.x.
This program should be able to do simple classification using the ML Scikit Learn library and tell if an incoming plane is a fighter or a bomber.
Use a decision Tree as a classifier. 
Train your classifier based on the data you collect.
An explanation of what this program is should be displayed for the user.
The UX target user is a first-time user.
Directions for the user on the UI.
Over comment your code with your own comments in your own words showing you understand the intent and function of almost every line of code. Make sure to use your own comments.
